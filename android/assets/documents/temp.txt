The Aim Of The Game
===================
The aim of the game is to save the Planet Earth from destruction. Each alien base will launch 2 missiles, one at Earth and one at the Moon Rover, once a countdown timer has expired. To destroy the alien bases Jetman will have to travel to each base and drop a bomb on it. Each time the base is destroyed a new wave begins. Each wave will become gradually more challenging and also introduce new enemies.

The Aliens
==========
The aliens that inhabit this moon are after your blood, and are hell bent on destroying Earth AND your Rover.

Bouncing Wheel
--------------
Not an alien as such. They just bounce along the moonscape and will kill Jetman on contact.

Green Block
-----------
Travels horizontally across the screen, at roughly the same speed as Jetman.

Asteroids
---------
Enter the screen diagonally and will kill Jetman on contact. They will occasionally leave a crater behind if they hit the ground.

3 Ball Spinner
--------------
These travel along in a fashion that gives the impression that they are climbing up and down invisible stairs.

Sparkle
-------
Exactly the same as the 3 Ball Spinner, but with added sparkle!

Star Spinner
------------
Travels horizontally across the screen, at roughly the same speed as Jetman.

The Blob
--------
Will follow Jetman around the screen, or hover above the Rover when Jetman
is aboard.

The Dog
-------
Will follow Jetman around the screen, or hover above the Rover when Jetman
is aboard.

Top Spinner
-----------
This is a magnetic alien, and will happily pinch a Teleporter and drag it halfway across the moonscape, dumping it in the middle of nowhere (which may be in mid-air!). These aliens can also use the Teleporters to move around.

Tubular Grabber
---------------
This is a magnetic alien, and will happily pinch a Teleporter and drag it halfway across the moonscape, dumping it in the middle of nowhere (which may be in mid-air!). These aliens can also use the Teleporters to move around.

Shooter
-------
These aliens will patrol the moonscape and shower Jetman with a hail of bullets.

Saturn
------
Acts in the same way as The Blob, only with more speed and more accuracy!

The Jetpac
==========
Jetman can walk on the lunar landscape or fly using the Jet Pac. The Jet Pac is equipped with a Quad Photon Phaser to blast any alien that gets in the way. There is limited fuel within the Jet Pac - so you`ll have to refuel often at the Lunar Rover. Do this by standing in front of the Rovers rear wheel and pressing <ACTION>. Jetman can carry items that are scattered around the lunar landscape, but remember that the items are heavy, so the Jet Pac will react slower and use more fuel.

Teleport Booths
===============
Jetman will come across two of these on the lunar landscape. To enter, stand in front of the teleporter and press <ACTION>, and Jetman will teleport across the landscape to the other booth. Jetman will automatically exit this booth on arrival. Jetman can enter the booth when carrying a bomb or blaster, which can be useful. He can also pick up a booth by landing on top and pressing <ACTION>. Be careful because there are 2 aliens which can also use the teleporters. If Jetman is in front of a teleporter when an alien appears out of it, he will die.

The Moon Rover
==============
The Moon Rover has room for one Jetman and an unlimited supply of bridging platforms and Jetpac fuel. There is enough room at the back of the rover to hold one object, such as a Bomb, which can be found scattered around the lunar landscape. The Rover can also be equipped with a blaster which can be used to shoot down aliens. Jetman can enter the Rover by moving into position between the wheels and pressing the <ACTION> button. To exit the Rover, press the same button. When Jetman is inside the rover he is invulnerable to everything other than the alien missile and the alien base defence towers. The rover cannot travel over holes in the terrain and any holes encountered will need to be repaired in order to take the rover any further. Jetman can alternatively carry the bomb to the alien base himself but that can be very dangerous due to limited jetpack fuel and also the possibility of encountering any enemies. If time is running out this can however be the only viable option. Bridging gaps in the terrain can be achieved by collecting a bridge section from the rover and placing them over the gaps. Bridge sections can be collected from the rover by standing in front of the rovers rear wheel and pressing the <ACTION> button. The rover can be used to carry the bomb to the alien base in safety. It can also be equipped with a blaster to shoot enemies. To place the bomb on the rover it needs to be dropped onto the flat rear section of the rover.

The Missile Base
================
Jetman MUST destroy the missile base before the missiles are launched. On the status panel there is a timer bar which, when it runs out, will signal the launching of two missiles. One of these missiles is aimed at Earth and the other is aimed at the Moon Rover. This missile can be shot down by Jetman and will award 500 points. Destroying this missile will automatically destroy the other missile AND the base! Destroying a base ends the level and activates the next. There will be another missile base located somewhere on the landscape, and more aliens to fight off.
