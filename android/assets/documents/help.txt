Lunar Jetman re-make is a re-imagining of the ZX Spectrum classic 'Lunar Jetman',
originally produced by 'Ultimate Play The Game' (later known as 'Rare').


The Aim Of The Game
===================

The aim of the game is to save the Planet Earth from destruction. Each alien base
will launch 2 missiles, one at Earth and one at the Moon Rover, once a countdown timer,
represented by the Yellow progress bar at the top of the screen, has expired.
The two missiles are connected by super-advanced alien wifi. Destroy one, and the other
will explode too.
Handy that, eh?

To destroy the alien bases Jetman will have to travel to each base and drop a bomb
(which spawns by the rover) on it. Each time the base is destroyed a new wave begins.
Each wave will become gradually more challenging and also introduce new enemies.

If the timer runs out before the base is destroyed and the missile is launched, it is
still possible to save the rover. In order to do this the missile will need to be shot
down or blocked from hitting the rover by sacrificing a life.


The Aliens
==========

The aliens that inhabit this moon are after your blood, and are hell bent on destroying
Earth AND your rover. In any order, they're not fussy!

    Bouncing Wheel
    --------------
    Not an alien as such. They come from somewhere though, not really sure where. They
    just bounce along the moonscape and will kill Jetman on contact.

    Green Block
    -----------
    Travels horizontally across the screen, at roughly the same speed as Jetman.

    Asteroids
    ---------
    Enter the screen diagonally and will kill Jetman on contact. They will occasionally
    leave a crater behind if they hit the ground.

    3 Ball Spinner
    --------------
    These travel along in a fashion that gives the impression that they are climbing
    up and down invisible stairs.

    Sparkle
    -------
    Exactly the same as the 3 Ball Spinner, but with added sparkle!

    Star Spinner
    ------------
    Travels horizontally across the screen, at roughly the same speed as Jetman.

    The Blob
    --------
    Will follow Jetman around the screen, or hover above the Rover when jetman
    is aboard.

    The Dog
    -------
    Will follow Jetman around the screen, or hover above the Rover when jetman
    is aboard.

    Top Spinner
    -----------
    This is a magnetic alien, and will happily pinch a Teleporter and drag it halfway
    across the moonscape, dumping it in the middle of nowhere (which may be in mid-air!).
    These aliens can also use the Teleporters to move around.

    Tubular Grabber
    ---------------
    This is a magnetic alien, and will happily pinch a Teleporter and drag it halfway
    across the moonscape, dumping it in the middle of nowhere (which may be in mid-air!).
    These aliens can also use the Teleporters to move around.

    Shooter
    -------
    These aliens will patrol the moonscape and shower Jetman with a hail of bullets.
    Shoot them before they get the chance!

    Saturn
    ------
    Acts in the same way as The Blob, only with more speed and more accuracy!


The Jetpac
==========

Jetman can walk on the lunar landscape or fly using the Jet Pac. The Jet Pac is
equipped with a Quad Photon Laser Phaser to blast any alien nasty that gets in the
way. Use it all the time. There is unlimited laser power.

There is limited fuel within the Jet Pac - so you`ll have to refuel often at the Lunar
Rover. Do this by standing in front of the Rovers rear wheel and pressing <ACTION>. Jetman
can carry items that are scattered around the lunar landscape, but remember that the items
are heavy, so the Jet Pac will react slower and use more fuel.

If Jetman walks over or lands on a hole he will hover and use Jet Pac fuel.


Extra Lives
===========

An extra life will be awarded after every 4th level.

Teleport Booths
===============

Jetman will come across two of these on the lunar landscape. To enter, stand in front of
the teleporter and press <ACTION>, and Jetman will teleport across the landscape to the
other booth. Jetman will automatically exit this booth on arrival.

Jetman can enter the booth when carrying a bomb or blaster, which can be useful. He can
also pick up a booth by landing on top and pressing <ACTION>.

Be careful because there are 2 aliens which can also use the teleporters. If Jetman is
in front of a teleporter when an alien appears out of it, he will die.


The Moon Rover
==============

The Moon Rover has room for one Jetman and an unlimited supply of bridging platforms
and Jetpac fuel. There is enough room at the back of the rover to hold one object, such
as a Bomb, which can be found scattered around the lunar landscape. The Rover can also be
equipped with a blaster which can be used to shoot down aliens.

Jetman can enter the Rover by moving into position between the wheels and pressing
the <ACTION> button. To exit the Rover, press the same button.

When Jetman is inside the rover he is invulnerable to everything other than the alien
missile and the alien base defence towers. The rover cannot travel over holes in the
terrain and any holes encountered will need to be repaired in order to take the rover
any further. Jetman can alternatively carry the bomb to the alien base himself but that
can be very dangerous due to limited jetpack fuel and also the possibility of encountering
any enemies. If time is running out this can however be the only viable option. Bridging
gaps in the terrain can be achieved by collecting a bridge section from the rover and
placing them over the gaps. Bridge sections can be collected from the rover by standing
in front of the rovers rear wheel and pressing the <ACTION> button.

The rover can be used to carry the bomb to the alien base in safety. It can also be
equipped with a blaster to shoot enemies. To place the bomb on the rover it needs to be
dropped onto the flat rear section of the rover.


The Missile Base
================

Jetman MUST destroy the missile base before the missiles are launched. On the status
panel there is a timer bar which, when it runs out, will signal the launching of two
missiles. One of these missiles is aimed at Earth and the other is aimed at the Moon Rover.
This missile can be shot down by Jetman and will award 500 points. Destroying this missile
will automatically destroy the other missile AND the base!

Destroying a base ends the level and activates the next. There will be another missile
base located somewhere on the landscape, and more aliens to fight off.
